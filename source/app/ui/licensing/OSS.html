The Crypto++ Library uses portions of Andy Polyakov's CRYPTOGAMS on Linux<br>
for 32-bit ARM with files aes_armv4.S, sha1_armv4.S and sha256_armv4.S.<br>
CRYPTOGAMS is dual licensed with a permissive BSD-style license. The<br>
CRYPTOGAMS license is reproduced below. You can disable Cryptogams code by<br>
undefining the relevant macros in config_asm.h.<br>
<br>
The Crypto++ Library uses portions of Jack Lloyd's Botan for ChaCha SSE2 and<br>
AVX. Botan placed the code in public domain for Crypto++ to use.<br>
